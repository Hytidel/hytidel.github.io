## About Me

🤣 Hi, my Chinese name is **Xi Wang** (**王曦**). 
It would be better if you call me by my English name, **Hytidel**, or its phonetic imitation in Chinese, **海底桃**.

😀 I am a senior undergraduate student at [SMS](https://math.szu.edu.cn/) and [CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/), 
advised by Prof. [Yang Zhou](https://zhouyangvcc.github.io/). 

😋 My research interests include **computer graphics** (CG), **computer vision** (CV) and their applications in **creative arts**.
