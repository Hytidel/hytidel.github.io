## About Me

🤣 Hi, my Chinese name is **Xi Wang** (**王曦**). 
It would be better if you call me by my English name, **Hytidel**, or its phonetic imitation in Chinese, **海底桃**.

😀 I am a senior undergraduate student at [SMS](https://math.szu.edu.cn/) and [CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). 
I am currently conducting research at [Visual Computing Research Center](https://vcc.tech) (VCC), advised by Prof. [Yang Zhou](https://zhouyangvcc.github.io/). 

😋 My research interests include **computer graphics** (CG), **computer vision** (CV) and their applications in **creative arts**. My recent research primarily focus on **real-time rendering**, **the theory of diffusion models**, and **image synthesis**. 

😇 I have a strong preference for research that involves **explicit modeling**, **solid theoretical foundations**, and **high interpretability**. 
I am not particularly fond of AI, especially training a neural network as a black box, with no insight into why and how it works. 
Instead, I primarily focus on leveraging existing pre-trained models to conduct research that is interpretable and theoretically grounded. 
I am not inclined toward overly engineering research.
Precisely, my interests lie in a balance of approximately 60%~70% theoretical work and 40%~30% engineering.

## Research Highlights

🧐 Navigate to the [Publications page](https://hytidel.github.io//publications) at the top of the page to browse all of my publications. 

💪 I have yet to produce work that fully meets my satisfaction, and I am actively working towards this goal.
