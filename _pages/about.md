## About Me

🤣 Hi, my Chinese name is **Xi Wang** (**王曦**). 
It would be better if you call me by my English name, **Hytidel**, or its phonetic imitation in Chinese, **海底桃**.

<!-- 😀 I am a senior undergraduate student at [SMS](https://math.szu.edu.cn/) and [CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/).  -->
<!-- I am currently conducting research at [Visual Computing Research Center](https://vcc.tech) (VCC), advised by Prof. [Yang Zhou](https://zhouyangvcc.github.io/).  -->

😀 I am currently an independent researcher, and closely work with Prof. [Yang Zhou](https://zhouyangvcc.github.io/) at [Visual Computing Research Center (VCC)](https://vcc.tech). 
Before that, I received my **B.S. degree in math** from [School of Mathematical Sciences (SMS)](https://math.szu.edu.cn/), [Shenzhen University (SZU)](https://www.szu.edu.cn/), and **B.Eng. degree in computer science** from [College of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/), [SZU](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). 

😋 My research interests include **computer graphics** (CG), **computer vision** (CV) and their applications in **creative arts**. My recent research primarily focus on **real-time rendering**, **AIGC-driven artistic creation**, and **the theory of diffusion models and reinforcement learning**. 

😇 I have a strong preference for research that involves **explicit modeling**, **solid theoretical foundations**, and **high interpretability**. 
I am not particularly fond of training a neural network as a black box, with no insight into why and how it works. 
<!-- Instead, I primarily focus on leveraging existing pre-trained models to conduct research that is interpretable and theoretically grounded. 
I am not inclined toward overly engineering research.
Precisely, my interests lie in a balance of approximately 60%~70% theoretical work and 40%~30% engineering. -->

🔮 I also have strong interests in **artistry** (music, visual arts) and **occultism** (mind-body-spirit, Tarot).

## Research Highlights

🧐 Navigate to the [Publications page](https://hytidel.github.io//publications) at the top of the page to browse all of my publications. 

💪 I have yet to produce work that fully meets my satisfaction, and I am actively working towards this goal.
